        <h1>Week 3: Fabrication</h1>

        <h2>So you're telling me a shrimp fried this rice?</h2>

        <p>
          This week, I put my CAD and fabrication skills to use by creating a kinetic sculpture. I worked on creating a sculpture of a shrimp frying rice. Originally, I was going to make some lame marble roller coaster but I came up with this genius idea when I was showering.

        <h2>Movement</h2>

        <p>
          The movement of the shrimp and wok are produced by cams which convert rotational movement into linear movement. By changing the design of the cams, I was able to encode a smooth up and down movement for the shrimp and a more abrupt jolt in the wok to mimic the movement of "pan tossing".
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas the shrimp is free standing, I attached a pivot to the wok in order to give it the desired "tossing" motion.

        <h2>Motor and Power</h2>

        <div class="image-duo">

          <img src="./Assets/Motor.JPG" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
          In order to actually attach the motor to the box of my kinetic sculpture, I used two M3 screws and some cleverly placed cutouts.
        </p>

        <div class="image-duo">
          <img src="./Assets/MotorMount.png" alt="">
          <img src="./Assets/ShaftMount.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
          The shaft of the motor is connected to a press-fit laser cut part which is then glued to another press-fit part that connects to the square dowel. The tolerances were a bit finnicky to get working, but now I have a secure but non-permanent way to connect the motor shaft to the square dowel!

        <p>
          My whole contraption is powered by a lithium ion battery pack which I soldered onto the motor.

        <h2>Art</h2>

        <div class="image-duo">
          <img src="./Assets/art.png" alt="">
          <img src="./Assets/art2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
          I created all the art within Onshape itself which surprisingly wasn't that bad. I ended up tracing some images of shrimp and fried rice and it turned out great. The engraving came out really nice too (besides when it caught on fire)!

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how my kinetic sculpture turned out. While it isn't the prettiest or most technically complex, I think its a good balance of form and function: it works completely fine without assitance and it's a pretty funny joke. If I were to continue interating, I would definetly fine tune the tolerances of the cutouts and account of the rotational movement of the wok in CAD instead of just using a box cutter. It would also be nice to give the Shrimp and Wok more exaggerated movements with better cams.

          This week also taught me why I shouldn't procrastinate these assignements!!!

(Yes, the CAD is actually well labeled and parameterized this time)</a>
